Current word translators only take one word as input and do not store words that have been searched for, effectively making the user stop what they're doing and lookup/learn the word at the very moment they are wondering about a translation. This program is intended to become a tool for 'translation procrastination'.

With database storage the end goal of this program is to allow the user to build a list of English words over a period of time - like a notepad. When the user is ready to sit down and learn their words, the English list of words is translated to Spanish words. Over many uses a user can build a database of Spanish words they've looked up and reinforce their language skills.
